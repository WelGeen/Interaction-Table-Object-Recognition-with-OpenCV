## Introduction  
This project explores **object recognition** and **projection mapping** using OpenCV. The **Interaction Table** is equipped with a camera and hardware, allowing students to experiment with detecting objects, tracking their position, rotation, and size, and using this data for creative and interactive experiences.  

A first **proof of concept** can be found here:  
👉 [Video Shape Tracking Demo](https://welgeen.nl/opencv/video-shape.html)  
In this example, a red piece of paper is tracked for its **position, rotation, and size**.  

## How to Get Started  
We encourage students to:  
1. **Sketch first!** Before coding, create a few sketches of your idea. Think about how object recognition could be used in an interactive way.  
2. **Experiment and build.** Once you have a solid concept, start coding and refining your project.  
3. **Try different technologies.** While OpenCV is the main tool, you are welcome to experiment with other programming languages and frameworks.  

## 10 Fun Challenges to Try  
Here are some exciting challenges to explore with this technology:  

1. **Music Table 🎵**  
   - Recognize shapes and rotations to play different musical notes.  
   - Use different paper colors to trigger various beats.  

2. **Interactive Puzzle 🧩**  
   - Design a puzzle where object recognition confirms correct placements.  
   - Add projection mapping for visual feedback.  

3. **Augmented Drawing ✏️**  
   - Track a colored pen or object to draw digital lines on a screen.  
   - Experiment with changing brush size based on distance.  

4. **Gesture-Controlled Game 🎮**  
   - Use object tracking to move a character or object in a game.  
   - Try adding multiple objects for multiplayer interaction.  

5. **Virtual DJ Table 🎛️**  
   - Control a virtual DJ mixer with paper cutouts.  
   - Rotate shapes to adjust sound effects and tempo.  

6. **Color-Sorting Machine 🌈**  
   - Use object recognition to detect colors and sort objects accordingly.  
   - Display sorting animations with projection mapping.  

7. **Interactive Storytelling 📖**  
   - Place different objects on the table to trigger story elements.  
   - Try integrating sound effects and animations.  

8. **AR Shadow Play 🏮**  
   - Recognize hand shapes and use projection mapping to cast interactive shadows.  
   - Create a storytelling experience based on gestures.  

9. **Smart Tabletop Game 🎲**  
   - Design a board game where object recognition detects moves and triggers actions.  
   - Experiment with turn-based mechanics.  

10. **Live Data Visualization 📊**  
   - Use tracked objects to manipulate data visualizations in real-time.  
   - Experiment with different chart types and interactive controls.
